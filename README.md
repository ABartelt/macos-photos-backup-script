   ```

3. Customize the backup paths in the script configuration section if needed:
   ```bash
   PHOTOS_LIBRARY="$HOME/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary"
   PHOTOS_BACKUP_ROOT="/Volumes/My Passport/photos"
   # ... other paths
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
./backup_full.sh
```

### Command Line Options

- `--new`: Force a new photos backup without considering previous backup date
- `--resume`: Resume a previously interrupted photos backup

- `--icloud-only`: Only backup iCloud Drive
- `--contacts-only`: Only backup Contacts
- `--projects-only`: Only backup projects directory
- `--config-only`: Only backup configuration files
- `--help`: Show help message

### Examples

Backup only configuration files:
```bash

```

Resume an interrupted photos backup:
```bash
./backup_full.sh --resume --photos-only
```

## Backup Structure

### Photos Backup
- Location: `/Volumes/My Passport/photos/`
- Maintains original photo metadata
- Creates date-stamped directories for incremental backups

### iCloud Backup
- Location: `/Volumes/My Passport/icloud_backup/`
- Mirrors iCloud Drive structure
- Excludes temporary files and .DS_Store

### Contacts Backup
- Location: `/Volumes/My Passport/contacts/`
- Format: vCard (.vcf)
- Compressed archives with date stamps
- Retains last 5 backups

### Projects Backup

- Date-stamped directories
- Excludes:
  - .git directories
  - node_modules
  - Python virtual environments
  - Compiled Python files
  - .DS_Store files

### Configuration Backup
- Location: `/Volumes/My Passport/config_backup/`
- Includes:
  - Shell configuration (.zshrc, .bashrc)
  - Git configuration
  - SSH settings
  - Custom scripts (.bin directory)
  - Application configs (.config directory)
  - Homebrew package list
- Removes dot prefixes in archive for better readability
- Excludes socket files and logs
- Retains last 5 backups

## Error Handling

- Validates backup drive presence
- Retries failed photo exports with reduced batch size
- Tracks and reports backup status for each component
- Provides detailed error messages and warnings

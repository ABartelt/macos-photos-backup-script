# macOS System Backup Script
A comprehensive backup solution for macOS systems that handles Photos libraries, iCloud Drive, contacts, development projects, and system configurations. The script provides a robust, incremental backup system with progress tracking and error handling.
## Hardware Requirements & Encryption
This backup script has been tested and works. I use a [Western Digital My Passport](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/WD-Passport-Portable-Hard-Drive/dp/B07VSPL8FJ/?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_w=HAclW&content-id=amzn1.sym.16038c01-cfea-4f09-a119-c9f8c051c46c%3Aamzn1.symc.fc11ad14-99c1-406b-aa77-051d0ba1aade&pf_rd_p=16038c01-cfea-4f09-a119-c9f8c051c46c&pf_rd_r=67WJ82KEWK3DHC0E0R8X&pd_rd_wg=DUkBe&pd_rd_r=b9dc90af-bc28-4953-a558-83cb9f68602a&ref_=pd_hp_d_atf_ci_mcx_mr_ca_hp_atf_d&th=1) which is using hardware encryption. These drives work seamlessly with macOS and provide excellent security through hardware-level encryption without compromising performance. The encryption is handled transparently by macOS once you set up the drive using the WD Security software, making it an ideal choice for secure backups.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ABartelt/macos-backup.git
   cd macos-backup
   ```

2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x backup_full.sh
   ```

3. Customize the backup paths in the script configuration section if needed:
   ```bash
   PHOTOS_LIBRARY="$HOME/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary"
   PHOTOS_BACKUP_ROOT="/Volumes/My Passport/photos"
   # ... other paths
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run a full system backup:
```bash
./backup_full.sh
```

### Command Line Options

- `--new`: Force a new photos backup without considering previous backup date
- `--resume`: Resume a previously interrupted photos backup
- `--photos-only`: Only backup Photos library
- `--icloud-only`: Only backup iCloud Drive
- `--contacts-only`: Only backup Contacts
- `--projects-only`: Only backup projects directory
- `--config-only`: Only backup configuration files
- `--help`: Show help message

### Examples

Backup only configuration files:
```bash
./backup_full.sh --config-only
```

Resume an interrupted photos backup:
```bash
./backup_full.sh --resume --photos-only
```

## Backup Structure

### Photos Backup
- Location: `/Volumes/My Passport/photos/`
- Maintains original photo metadata
- Creates date-stamped directories for incremental backups

### iCloud Backup
- Location: `/Volumes/My Passport/icloud_backup/`
- Mirrors iCloud Drive structure
- Excludes temporary files and .DS_Store

### Contacts Backup
- Location: `/Volumes/My Passport/contacts/`
- Format: vCard (.vcf)
- Compressed archives with date stamps
- Retains last 5 backups

### Projects Backup
- Location: `/Volumes/My Passport/projects_backup/`
- Date-stamped directories
- Excludes:
  - .git directories
  - node_modules
  - Python virtual environments
  - Compiled Python files
  - .DS_Store files

### Configuration Backup
- Location: `/Volumes/My Passport/config_backup/`
- Includes:
  - Shell configuration (.zshrc, .bashrc)
  - Git configuration
  - SSH settings
  - Custom scripts (.bin directory)
  - Application configs (.config directory)
  - Homebrew package list
- Removes dot prefixes in archive for better readability
- Excludes socket files and logs
- Retains last 5 backups

## Error Handling

- Validates backup drive presence
- Retries failed photo exports with reduced batch size
- Tracks and reports backup status for each component
- Provides detailed error messages and warnings
- Creates logs with timestamps for debugging

## Maintenance

The script automatically maintains backup history by:
- Keeping the last 5 backups for contacts and configurations
- Cleaning up temporary files after backup
- Removing old backup archives
- Managing incremental backups for photos
